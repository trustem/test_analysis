# test_analysis
In this project the aim was to analyse the 27.5M lines of database to know which questions are making sense and which are not. 
So then to delete the questions from the database that are not making sense, which will increase the quality of the tests that Ustudy are giving, increasing the precision of detecting the level of the student. 
testdb_1000.csv is a little part of the database UStudy gave me. Unfortunately, I can not upload the whole database.
